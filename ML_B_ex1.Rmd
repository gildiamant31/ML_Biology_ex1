## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

First, load the tidyverse library, which contains everything we need to perform this analysis.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

import the dataset to a local variable:
```{r}
surveys <- read_csv("netflix-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-imdb.csv")
```

taking a quick look:
```{r}
str(surveys)
view(surveys)
```

Some information is already known to us just from calling the table. We know how many rows and columns there are, and we have some idea regarding the type of variables (text, numeric) but not much else.

A few commands to help us learn more about the structure of the data are shown here:

```{r}
dim(surveys)
nrow(surveys) 
ncol(surveys) 

head(surveys)
tail(surveys)

names(surveys)

str(surveys)
summary(surveys)
```
## Data Variation

One important fact to know about our data is its variation, can you think of reasons why? 

```{r}
# plotting a scatter plot 
ggplot(data = surveys) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = "IMDb Score", y = "Hidden Gem Score"))

# creating boxplot
ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = "IMDb Score", y = "Hidden Gem Score")) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_width("IMDb Score", 0.1)))

# Variance between two categorical variables
ggplot(data = surveys) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = "IMDb Score", y = Genre))

```

## Data Visualisation - It is not working on this dataset!!

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Title))

ggplot(data = surveys) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = "Hidden Gem Score"), binwidth = 0.5)

ggplot(data = surveys) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = "Hidden Gem Score"), binwidth = 0.1)

ggplot(data = surveys) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Title, fill = Title))

ggplot(data = surveys) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Title, fill = Genre))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
